# C++ Demoduler for Python

A very useless python script which automatically compresses all your separate .h,.hpp,.c,.cpp files to a mega file based on the configurations.

## Dependencies

Packages:
- `os`

## Usage

Run:
`pyton cpp_demoduler.py`
After that, supply the `folder_path` where you need to "demodule" your files.
